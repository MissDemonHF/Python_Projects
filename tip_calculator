### Tip Calculator Project:

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill?\n$"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?\n"))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?\n"))
print("Calculating tip")

total_tip_amount = bill * (tip / 100)
total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
bill_per_person = total_bill / people

### Rounding to 2 decimal places (2 options)
## 1. round function
final_per_person = round(bill_per_person, 2)
## 2. format function
# final_per_person = "{:.2f}".format(bill_per_person)

print(f"Please have each person pay ${final_per_person}")
